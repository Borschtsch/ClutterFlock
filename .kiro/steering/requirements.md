# Development Requirements & Standards

## Functional Requirements Summary

### Core Capabilities (Must Have)
- **FR-001:** Folder Management - Add/remove unlimited folders, recursive scanning with progress
- **FR-002:** File Analysis & Caching - SHA-256 hashing with parallel processing and graceful error handling
- **FR-003:** Duplicate Detection - Multi-factor matching (name, size, hash) across ALL folders with similarity metrics
- **FR-004:** Results Display & Filtering - Sortable ListView with similarity/size filtering and multi-column sorting
- **FR-005:** File Comparison Interface - WinMerge-style dual-pane view with color-coded file status
- **FR-006:** Project Persistence - Save/load complete state in JSON-based .cfp format (ClutterFlock Project) with backward compatibility for legacy .dfp files
- **FR-007:** Progress Tracking & Cancellation - Real-time progress with cancellation support

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance Standards
- **Process 10,000 files per minute** on modern hardware
- **Memory usage <2GB** for typical datasets
- **UI responsiveness <100ms** for user interactions
- **Handle 100,000+ subfolders** efficiently without UI freezing

#### Reliability Standards
- **100% accurate duplicate detection** based on hash comparison
- **Graceful error handling** for file system issues (permissions, missing files)
- **Safe cancellation** with proper resource cleanup
- **Data integrity** during all operations

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- All long-running operations MUST be async with CancellationToken support
- UI updates MUST use Dispatcher.BeginInvoke for thread safety
- Error handling MUST be comprehensive with user-friendly messages
- Resource disposal MUST follow proper IDisposable patterns
- Progress reporting MUST be implemented for operations >1 second

### Testing Requirements
- **Achieve 100% code coverage** for all production code
- Test with large datasets (100,000+ files)
- Validate memory usage and performance metrics
- Test cancellation and cleanup procedures
- Verify UI responsiveness during heavy operations
- Test error scenarios (permissions, missing files, network issues)

### Architecture Constraints
- Windows-only desktop application (.NET 9, WPF)
- No external NuGet dependencies (minimal dependency approach)
- Read-only operations (never modify user files)
- Local processing only (no network communication)
- Single-instance application (no multi-user support)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Performance Patterns
```csharp
// Use configurable parallelism
var options = new ParallelOptions 
{ 
    MaxDegreeOfParallelism = Math.Max(1, Environment.ProcessorCount - 1),
    CancellationToken = cancellationToken 
};

// Batch UI updates for responsiveness
if (processedItems % 50 == 0)
{
    progress?.Report(new AnalysisProgress { ... });
    await Task.Yield(); // Allow UI updates
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns
```csharp
try
{
    // File operation
}
catch (UnauthorizedAccessException)
{
    // Skip file, continue processing
    continue;
}
catch (IOException)
{
    // Handle file in use, continue processing
    continue;
}
```

### Threading Patterns
```csharp
// Background processing
var result = await Task.Run(() => 
{
    // CPU-intensive work
}, cancellationToken);

// UI updates
if (!Dispatcher.CheckAccess())
{
    Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(() => UpdateUI());
    return;
}
```
