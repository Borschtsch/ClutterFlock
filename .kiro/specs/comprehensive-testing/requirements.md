# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes comprehensive test coverage for the ClutterFlock application and creates development workflow guidance to ensure code changes are validated through automated testing. The system will include unit tests, integration tests, and a steering document that guides developers to run tests after code changes and handle test failures appropriately.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit test coverage for all core business logic, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN all Core classes SHALL have unit tests with at least 80% code coverage
2. WHEN testing DuplicateAnalyzer THEN the system SHALL verify duplicate detection accuracy with various file scenarios
3. WHEN testing FileComparer THEN the system SHALL validate hash comparison, size comparison, and name comparison logic
4. WHEN testing FolderScanner THEN the system SHALL verify recursive scanning, error handling, and progress reporting
5. WHEN testing CacheManager THEN the system SHALL validate caching operations, cache invalidation, and memory management
6. WHEN testing ProjectManager THEN the system SHALL verify project save/load functionality with various file formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for the complete workflow, so that I can ensure all components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test complete folder analysis workflows from start to finish
2. WHEN testing with sample data THEN the system SHALL verify end-to-end duplicate detection across multiple folders
3. WHEN testing project persistence THEN the system SHALL validate complete save/load cycles with real project data
4. WHEN testing cancellation scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify proper cleanup and resource disposal
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL validate graceful handling of file system errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests to validate system requirements, so that I can ensure the application meets its performance criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL validate processing speed of at least 10,000 files per minute
2. WHEN testing with large datasets THEN the system SHALL verify memory usage remains below 2GB
3. WHEN testing UI responsiveness THEN the system SHALL ensure UI updates occur within 100ms
4. WHEN testing scalability THEN the system SHALL handle 100,000+ subfolders without performance degradation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a test framework setup that integrates with the existing MSTest infrastructure, so that tests can be run consistently in the development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the test framework THEN the system SHALL extend the existing ClutterFlock.Tests project
2. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL follow a clear folder structure separating unit, integration, and performance tests
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support both Visual Studio Test Explorer and dotnet test CLI
4. WHEN generating test reports THEN the system SHALL provide code coverage metrics and test results
5. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mock objects and test utilities for isolated testing, so that I can test components independently without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing file system operations THEN the system SHALL provide mock file system implementations
2. WHEN testing async operations THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for testing cancellation and progress reporting
3. WHEN testing UI components THEN the system SHALL provide mock ViewModels and test data
4. WHEN testing caching THEN the system SHALL provide controllable cache implementations for testing
5. WHEN creating test data THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for generating sample files and folder structures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want steering documentation that guides the test-driven development workflow, so that I follow consistent practices when making code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making code changes THEN the steering document SHALL instruct running tests before and after changes
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the steering document SHALL guide reporting failures and potential fixes rather than immediately fixing tests
3. WHEN tests don't build THEN the steering document SHALL provide troubleshooting steps and escalation procedures
4. WHEN adding new features THEN the steering document SHALL require corresponding test coverage
5. WHEN refactoring code THEN the steering document SHALL ensure existing tests continue to pass

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test execution integrated into the development workflow, so that tests are run consistently and failures are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the solution THEN the system SHALL optionally run tests as part of the build process
2. WHEN tests fail during build THEN the system SHALL halt the build and report specific failures
3. WHEN running tests via CLI THEN the system SHALL support filtering by category (unit, integration, performance)
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL output results in multiple formats (console, XML, HTML)
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics including coverage percentages
