# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on achieving 100% statement and branch coverage for the ClutterFlock application by identifying and fixing coverage gaps in the existing test suite. The current coverage is only 11.7% line coverage and 10.3% branch coverage, with many core classes having 0% coverage despite having unit tests written. The system will analyze coverage gaps, fix non-executing tests, and add missing test scenarios to achieve comprehensive coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix coverage gaps in existing unit tests, so that all core business logic achieves 100% statement and branch coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing current coverage THEN the system SHALL identify why DuplicateAnalyzer, ErrorRecoveryService, FolderScanner, ProjectManager, and MainViewModel have 0% coverage despite having tests
2. WHEN fixing test execution issues THEN all existing unit tests SHALL run successfully and contribute to coverage metrics
3. WHEN running the complete test suite THEN all Core classes SHALL achieve at least 95% statement coverage and 90% branch coverage
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL cover all conditional branches, exception handling paths, and async operation scenarios
5. WHEN validating coverage THEN the system SHALL ensure no unreachable code exists and all public methods are tested
6. WHEN measuring final coverage THEN the overall project SHALL achieve 100% statement coverage and 95% branch coverage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze and fix specific coverage gaps in each core component, so that every method, property, and code path is thoroughly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing DuplicateAnalyzer coverage THEN the system SHALL identify why 0% of 286 lines are covered and fix test execution issues
2. WHEN analyzing ErrorRecoveryService coverage THEN the system SHALL identify why 0% of 212 lines are covered and add missing test scenarios
3. WHEN analyzing FolderScanner coverage THEN the system SHALL identify why 0% of 160 lines are covered and fix async test execution
4. WHEN analyzing ProjectManager coverage THEN the system SHALL identify why 0% of 35 lines are covered and add file I/O test scenarios
5. WHEN analyzing MainViewModel coverage THEN the system SHALL identify why 0% of 312 lines are covered and add UI command test scenarios

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and test all uncovered branches and conditional paths, so that every decision point in the code is validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing branch coverage THEN the system SHALL identify all 522 branches and ensure 95% are covered by tests
2. WHEN testing conditional logic THEN the system SHALL cover all if/else branches, switch statements, and ternary operators
3. WHEN testing exception handling THEN the system SHALL cover all try/catch blocks and exception throwing scenarios
4. WHEN testing async operations THEN the system SHALL cover all cancellation paths, timeout scenarios, and completion states
5. WHEN testing null checks THEN the system SHALL cover all null reference validation and defensive programming paths

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix test infrastructure issues that prevent tests from executing, so that all written tests contribute to coverage metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN investigating test execution THEN the system SHALL identify why 125 tests pass but contribute minimal coverage
2. WHEN fixing mock implementations THEN all mock services SHALL properly simulate real component behavior for coverage
3. WHEN configuring test runners THEN the system SHALL ensure tests execute against the main application code, not test-only code
4. WHEN validating test isolation THEN each test SHALL run independently without affecting coverage of other tests
5. WHEN running coverage analysis THEN the system SHALL accurately measure coverage of the main ClutterFlock assembly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add missing test scenarios for uncovered code paths, so that every line of code is executed during testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying missing scenarios THEN the system SHALL add tests for all constructor overloads, property setters, and method parameters
2. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL add tests for all exception throwing scenarios and error recovery paths
3. WHEN testing async methods THEN the system SHALL add tests for cancellation, progress reporting, and completion scenarios
4. WHEN testing UI interactions THEN the system SHALL add tests for all command executions, property changes, and event handling
5. WHEN testing file operations THEN the system SHALL add tests for all file I/O scenarios, permission errors, and data validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that all tests execute real application code, so that coverage metrics accurately reflect the testing of production code paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL ensure tests execute methods from the main ClutterFlock assembly, not test assemblies
2. WHEN using mocks THEN the system SHALL verify that mocks are used for dependencies only, not for the classes under test
3. WHEN measuring coverage THEN the system SHALL exclude test code, mock implementations, and generated code from coverage calculations
4. WHEN validating test quality THEN each test SHALL assert meaningful behavior and state changes in the system under test
5. WHEN achieving 100% coverage THEN the system SHALL verify that all covered lines represent real business logic execution

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive coverage reporting and validation, so that I can verify 100% coverage has been achieved and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating coverage reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed line-by-line coverage information for all source files
2. WHEN identifying uncovered code THEN the system SHALL highlight specific lines, branches, and methods that lack test coverage
3. WHEN validating coverage quality THEN the system SHALL ensure covered lines represent meaningful test execution, not just code loading
4. WHEN maintaining coverage THEN the system SHALL provide automated checks to prevent coverage regression
5. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL generate both summary statistics and detailed coverage reports in HTML format

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive integration tests that validate end-to-end workflows, so that I can ensure all components work together correctly in realistic scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test complete folder analysis workflows from start to finish
2. WHEN testing project persistence THEN the system SHALL validate save/load cycles with real file I/O operations
3. WHEN testing cancellation scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify proper cleanup and resource management across all components
4. WHEN testing error recovery THEN the system SHALL validate that errors in one component don't break the entire workflow
5. WHEN testing with real file systems THEN the system SHALL handle actual file permissions, network drives, and large datasets

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that validate component interactions and data flow, so that I can catch issues that unit tests might miss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing component integration THEN the system SHALL verify data flows correctly between CacheManager, FolderScanner, and DuplicateAnalyzer
2. WHEN testing UI integration THEN the system SHALL validate that MainViewModel correctly orchestrates all core services
3. WHEN testing progress reporting THEN the system SHALL verify that progress updates flow correctly from core services to the UI
4. WHEN testing concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL validate thread safety and proper synchronization between components
5. WHEN testing memory management THEN the system SHALL verify that caches are properly shared and cleaned up across components

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that simulate realistic user scenarios, so that I can validate the application behaves correctly under real-world conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simulating typical user workflows THEN the system SHALL test adding folders, running analysis, filtering results, and saving projects
2. WHEN testing with various folder structures THEN the system SHALL handle nested hierarchies, symbolic links, and mixed file types
3. WHEN testing with large datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain performance and memory usage within acceptable limits
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle permission errors, missing files, and corrupted data
5. WHEN testing cancellation during operations THEN the system SHALL properly stop all background tasks and clean up resources
