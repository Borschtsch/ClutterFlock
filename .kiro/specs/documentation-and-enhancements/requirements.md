# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes the ClutterFlock development cycle by adding comprehensive documentation, advanced user experience improvements, and intelligent analysis capabilities. The requirements cover both the completion of development documentation needed for maintainability and release, as well as user-focused enhancements that make the application more powerful for managing large backup archives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Data Export and Reporting

**User Story:** As a user who has completed duplicate analysis, I want to export detailed reports of my findings, so that I can share results with others or process the data with external tools for cleanup automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis results are available THEN the system SHALL export folder matches to CSV with columns for folder paths, similarity percentage, file counts, and total size
2. WHEN viewing specific folder comparisons THEN the system SHALL export detailed file lists showing duplicate files, unique files, and metadata
3. WHEN generating summary reports THEN the system SHALL calculate total potential space savings and provide duplicate statistics
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include analysis metadata like scan date, filter criteria used, and total folders analyzed

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Error Recovery and User Guidance

**User Story:** As a user working with diverse file systems including network drives and external storage, I want clear error handling and recovery options, so that I can resolve issues and continue my analysis without losing progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering permission errors THEN the system SHALL display specific folder paths that failed and suggest running as administrator or checking permissions
2. WHEN files become inaccessible during analysis THEN the system SHALL continue processing other files and provide a summary of skipped items
3. WHEN operations fail due to system resources THEN the system SHALL offer to reduce parallelism or suggest closing other applications
4. WHEN network drives disconnect THEN the system SHALL pause operations and offer to retry when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 3: Smart Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user analyzing massive backup archives on various hardware configurations, I want the application to automatically optimize its performance, so that I can complete analysis efficiently regardless of my system's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system memory usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce batch sizes and display memory optimization message
2. WHEN CPU usage is consistently high THEN the system SHALL offer to reduce parallelism with user confirmation
3. WHEN processing very large files (>1GB) THEN the system SHALL use streaming hash computation to avoid memory issues
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display performance metrics including files per second, memory peak usage, and total processing time

### Requirement 4: Advanced Project Management with Validation

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple backup analysis projects over time, I want intelligent project management that validates data integrity, so that I can reliably resume work and track changes in my backup archives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving projects THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive metadata: creation date, folder count, total files analyzed, and analysis summary statistics
2. WHEN loading projects THEN the system SHALL validate that source folders still exist and warn about any missing or moved directories
3. WHEN opening recent projects THEN the system SHALL display a recent projects list with project summaries and last modified dates
4. WHEN source folders have changed since last analysis THEN the system SHALL detect modifications and offer incremental re-analysis options

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Analysis Insights

**User Story:** As a user trying to understand my backup organization and optimize storage, I want detailed insights about my duplicate analysis results, so that I can make informed decisions about which folders to keep or remove.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display summary statistics including total duplicates found, potential space savings, and largest duplicate groups
2. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL highlight folders with highest space savings potential and most recent modification dates
3. WHEN examining folder pairs THEN the system SHALL show which folder is more complete (has more files) and which was modified more recently
4. WHEN filtering results THEN the system SHALL maintain running totals of visible matches and potential space savings for current filter criteria

### Requirement 6: Batch Operations and Automation Support

**User Story:** As a power user with systematic backup cleanup needs, I want batch operation capabilities, so that I can efficiently process multiple duplicate folder decisions and prepare for automated cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing duplicate folders THEN the system SHALL allow marking multiple folder pairs for batch actions (keep left, keep right, or manual review)
2. WHEN batch decisions are made THEN the system SHALL generate action scripts or reports that can be used with external tools
3. WHEN working with large result sets THEN the system SHALL provide bulk filtering options to quickly focus on high-priority duplicates
4. WHEN preparing for cleanup THEN the system SHALL validate that selected actions won't result in data loss by checking file completeness

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Code Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining or extending ClutterFlock, I want comprehensive code documentation, so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend the codebase efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing Core classes THEN the system SHALL have XML documentation comments for all public methods, properties, and complex algorithms
2. WHEN examining Services interfaces THEN the system SHALL have complete interface documentation with parameter descriptions, return value explanations, and usage examples
3. WHEN viewing ViewModels THEN the system SHALL have documented property purposes, command behaviors, and data binding patterns
4. WHEN accessing Models THEN the system SHALL have documented data structures with field explanations, validation rules, and serialization behavior

### Requirement 8: Architecture and Development Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer joining the ClutterFlock project or planning future enhancements, I want clear architecture documentation, so that I can quickly understand the system design and follow established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive architecture documentation explaining the layered design and MVVM implementation
2. WHEN understanding component relationships THEN the system SHALL have dependency diagrams showing service interactions and data flow
3. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL have documented extension points, coding standards, and architectural patterns to follow
4. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL have documented debugging approaches and common problem resolution strategies

### Requirement 9: User Documentation and Help System

**User Story:** As an end user of ClutterFlock, I want comprehensive help documentation and guidance, so that I can efficiently use all application features and resolve issues independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application for the first time THEN the system SHALL provide an integrated quick start guide with step-by-step instructions
2. WHEN performing common tasks THEN the system SHALL have accessible help documentation for typical workflows like scanning, filtering, and project management
3. WHEN encountering issues THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help, troubleshooting guidance, and FAQ accessible from within the application
4. WHEN using advanced features THEN the system SHALL have detailed explanations of filtering options, sorting capabilities, and export functionality
