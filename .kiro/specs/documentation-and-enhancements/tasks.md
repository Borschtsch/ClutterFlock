  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Analysis Insights and Statistics

  - Create InsightData model for comprehensive analysis insights
  - Implement insight calculation logic in DuplicateAnalyzer
  - Add space savings calculation and high-priority duplicate identification
  - Create summary statistics display in MainViewModel
  - Implement running totals for filtered results with potential savings
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Batch Operations System

  - Create IBatchOperationService interface for marking and managing batch actions
  - Implement BatchAction model and BatchActionType enumeration
  - Add batch action marking functionality to MainViewModel
  - Create action validation to prevent data loss scenarios
