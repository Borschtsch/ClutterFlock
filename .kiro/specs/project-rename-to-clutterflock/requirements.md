# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive renaming of the FolderDupFinder project to ClutterFlock. This includes updating all file names, namespaces, project references, documentation, and any hardcoded strings throughout the codebase. The renaming should maintain all existing functionality while providing a fresh brand identity for the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project File and Solution Renaming

**User Story:** As a developer working with the renamed project, I want all project files and solution files to reflect the new ClutterFlock name, so that the project structure is consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN renaming project files THEN the system SHALL rename FolderDupFinder.csproj to ClutterFlock.csproj
2. WHEN renaming solution files THEN the system SHALL rename FolderDupFinder.sln to ClutterFlock.sln
3. WHEN updating solution references THEN the system SHALL update all internal project references to use the new ClutterFlock name
4. WHEN renaming workspace files THEN the system SHALL rename FolderDupFinder.code-workspace to ClutterFlock.code-workspace

### Requirement 2: Namespace and Code Structure Updates

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the ClutterFlock codebase, I want all namespaces and code references to use the new name consistently, so that the code is properly organized and follows naming conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating namespaces THEN the system SHALL change all FolderDupFinder namespaces to ClutterFlock throughout the codebase
2. WHEN updating XAML references THEN the system SHALL update all x:Class and namespace references in XAML files
3. WHEN updating using statements THEN the system SHALL update all using FolderDupFinder statements to using ClutterFlock
4. WHEN updating assembly references THEN the system SHALL ensure all internal assembly references use the new ClutterFlock name

### Requirement 3: User Interface and Display Text Updates

**User Story:** As an end user of ClutterFlock, I want the application interface to display the new name consistently, so that the branding is professional and cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying window titles THEN the system SHALL show "ClutterFlock" instead of "Folder Duplicates Finder"
2. WHEN showing application names THEN the system SHALL use "ClutterFlock" in all user-visible text
3. WHEN displaying file dialogs THEN the system SHALL use "ClutterFlock Project (*.cfp)" instead of "Duplicate Folder Project (*.dfp)"
4. WHEN showing status messages THEN the system SHALL reference ClutterFlock where appropriate

### Requirement 4: Documentation and README Updates

**User Story:** As a user or developer reading project documentation, I want all documentation to reflect the new ClutterFlock name and branding, so that the information is accurate and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the README THEN the system SHALL display ClutterFlock as the project name and update all references
2. WHEN viewing documentation THEN the system SHALL update all FolderDupFinder references to ClutterFlock
3. WHEN reading steering files THEN the system SHALL update technology stack and requirements documentation
4. WHEN viewing spec files THEN the system SHALL update existing specification documents to reference ClutterFlock

### Requirement 5: File Extension and Project Format Updates

**User Story:** As a user saving and loading projects, I want the new file extension to reflect the ClutterFlock branding, so that project files are clearly associated with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving projects THEN the system SHALL use .cfp (ClutterFlock Project) extension instead of .dfp
2. WHEN loading projects THEN the system SHALL support both .cfp and .dfp extensions for backward compatibility
3. WHEN displaying file dialogs THEN the system SHALL show "ClutterFlock Project (*.cfp)" as the primary format
4. WHEN updating project data THEN the system SHALL maintain the same internal structure with updated metadata

### Requirement 6: Build and Configuration Updates

**User Story:** As a developer building the ClutterFlock project, I want all build configurations and output files to use the new name, so that the build process is consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL generate ClutterFlock.exe instead of FolderDupFinder.exe
2. WHEN creating output directories THEN the system SHALL use ClutterFlock naming in bin and obj folders
3. WHEN generating assembly info THEN the system SHALL update assembly metadata to reflect ClutterFlock
4. WHEN creating NuGet packages THEN the system SHALL use ClutterFlock naming conventions

### Requirement 7: Version Control and Git Updates

**User Story:** As a developer working with version control, I want the repository and commit history to properly reflect the renaming while maintaining project history, so that development continuity is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL update any FolderDupFinder-specific patterns to ClutterFlock
2. WHEN maintaining git history THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing commit history and file tracking
3. WHEN updating repository references THEN the system SHALL update any hardcoded repository paths or names
4. WHEN creating new commits THEN the system SHALL reflect the ClutterFlock naming in commit messages

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As an existing user of FolderDupFinder, I want to be able to open my existing .dfp project files in the renamed ClutterFlock application, so that I don't lose my previous work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening legacy .dfp files THEN the system SHALL load them successfully without data loss
2. WHEN saving legacy projects THEN the system SHALL offer to save as .cfp format while preserving .dfp compatibility
3. WHEN migrating projects THEN the system SHALL maintain all cached data and analysis results
4. WHEN displaying legacy projects THEN the system SHALL show appropriate migration prompts or notifications
