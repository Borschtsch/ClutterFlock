# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A critical threading bug has been identified in the integration test `ProgressReporting_Integration_FlowsCorrectlyThroughComponents` that causes a `System.InvalidOperationException: Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute` error. This bug occurs when the test attempts to enumerate a collection that is being concurrently modified by progress reporting callbacks, causing the GitHub Actions build to fail.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration tests to run successfully without threading exceptions, so that the CI/CD pipeline can validate code changes reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `ProgressReporting_Integration_FlowsCorrectlyThroughComponents` test runs THEN it SHALL complete without throwing `InvalidOperationException`
2. WHEN progress updates are being reported concurrently THEN the test SHALL safely access the progress collection without enumeration conflicts
3. WHEN the test validates progress phases THEN it SHALL use thread-safe collection access patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all integration tests to be thread-safe, so that they can reliably test concurrent operations without false failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests access shared collections THEN they SHALL use appropriate synchronization mechanisms
2. WHEN progress reporting occurs during tests THEN the test SHALL capture progress updates in a thread-safe manner
3. WHEN multiple threads modify test data collections THEN the test SHALL prevent race conditions and collection modification exceptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the threading fix to maintain test accuracy, so that the tests continue to validate the actual progress reporting behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the threading issue is fixed THEN the test SHALL still validate that multiple analysis phases are reported
2. WHEN progress updates are captured safely THEN the test SHALL still verify progress value correctness and ordering
3. WHEN thread-safe collection access is implemented THEN the test SHALL maintain the same validation logic for progress reporting integration
